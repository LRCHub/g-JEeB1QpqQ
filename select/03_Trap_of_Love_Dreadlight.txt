Your unfeeling heart imprisons me
Careless eyes too blind to see
Empty words, an iron cage
Broken heart, bleeding rage

Can't wait for you and me
It's time I break free

Trap of love
Snared by desire
Trap of love
Burned by your fire
Trap of love
Snared by desire
Trap of love
Beware the trap of love

Let me be, it's time we part
Set me free, uncage my heart

Can't wait for you and me
It's time for you to see

Trap of love
Snared by desire
Trap of love
Burned by your fire
Trap of love
Snared by desire
Trap of love
Beware the trap of love

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ah-ah-ah-ah

Trap of love
Snared by desire
Trap of love
Burned by your fire
Trap of love
Snared by desire
Trap of love
Beware the trap of love
